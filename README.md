## This is an Airdrop Project. The First Goal is to create a functional Airdrop Contract using Foundry and to build a simple, minimalistic frontend for the claimin process.

Key Components:

1. Token Contract
First, we need an ERC20 token that will be distributed. The contract should:
- Have standard ERC20 functionality
- Include minting capabilities (likely restricted to owner/admin)
- Have basic access control for administrative functions
- Consider implementing pause functionality for emergencies

1. Airdrop Contract
The main contract needs to:
- Store the token address
- Allow uploading of merkle root for recipient verification
- Handle claiming functionality
- Include emergency withdrawal functions
- Implement reentrancy protection
- Track claimed status efficiently using bit mapping

1. Testing Structure:
Here's what we'll need to test thoroughly:

```solidity
// Token Tests (test/Token.t.sol)
- Test basic ERC20 functionality
- Test minting restrictions
- Test transfer scenarios
- Test access control
- Test pause functionality if implemented

// Airdrop Tests (test/Airdrop.t.sol)
- Test merkle root updates
- Test claiming functionality
- Test duplicate claim prevention
- Test emergency functions
- Test gas optimization scenarios
- Test batch claiming if implemented

// Integration Tests (test/Integration.t.sol)
- Test full airdrop workflow
- Test edge cases with real data
```

4. Deployment Scripts:
```solidity
// script/DeployToken.s.sol
- Deploy token contract
- Set initial parameters
- Verify contract

// script/DeployAirdrop.s.sol
- Deploy airdrop contract
- Link token contract
- Set initial merkle root
- Transfer initial token balance
```

5. Helper Scripts:
```javascript
// script/helpers/
- generateMerkleRoot.js (creates merkle root from recipient list)
- generateProofs.js (generates individual proofs for recipients)
- verifyAirdrop.js (validates deployment and settings)
```

6. Additional Supporting Files:
```
- .env (environment variables)
- .gitignore (exclude sensitive files)
- foundry.toml (configuration)
- package.json (dependencies)
- README.md (documentation)
```

Implementation Approach:
1. Start with the token contract and its tests
2. Build the airdrop contract with basic functionality
3. Add merkle verification
4. Implement claiming logic
5. Add security features
6. Write deployment scripts
7. Create helper utilities
8. Write comprehensive tests
9. Document everything

Would you like me to provide more detailed specifications for any of these components? We can then start implementing them one by one, beginning with whichever piece you'd prefer to tackle first.

Also, do you have any specific requirements for:
- The token supply and distribution mechanics?
- The claiming period duration?
- Any special access control needs?
